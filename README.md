### Mr Fix-It
#### A repair technician job service.

#### Description
 This is a website for Mr. Fix-It, a crowd-sourced repair company. The site is built around a simple concept: Users post jobs that need to be completed. Then, registered Workers can claim, perform, and complete those jobs.

COMPLETED:
* Users can register and log on
* Users may sign up to be "workers" on the site.
* New jobs may be added to the jobs list.
* A job can be assigned to a worker.
* A worker may take on multiple jobs from the Worker Dashboard.

IN PROGRESS
* Make *claiming* a job an **AJAX** action.

NEXT UP
* A worker may designate one **active** job at a time. **AJAX**
* Workers may mark jobs complete, and select a new active job. **AJAX**


#### Further Exploration
If you finish all objectives with time to spare, consider implementing additional features such as:

Add styling to this site. If you need some inspiration, Angie's List is an example of this type of site.
Create a page where users may see all jobs they've posted, and their status.
Add the ability for Users to leave reviews on Workers. You might allow Workers to leave reviews on Users, too.
Allow Users to update or delete their job postings.
List completed and/or pending jobs separately from those still seeking a Worker.
Allow Workers to comment on jobs, so they can ask any clarifying questions before claiming.
